HOW TO FIND THE FLAG:

Let's analyse the binary file bonus0. gdb level0

info functions -> 3 functions main, pp and p

disas main -> create a char array of size 42 then call to pp and puts with the argument of the array.

disas pp -> in the function pp two char arrays of size 20 created on the stack
two calls of the function p with the argument of the first array and the string " - " then the same but with the second array 

then strcpy the first array in the argument buf of the function. put a space a the end of buf and strcat the second array in buf

disas p -> create a char array of size 4096 .print the second argument then wait for the user to type with read then search for a '\n' then strncpy 20 char of buf in the first argument.

The problem that can occurs here is that if the user types more than 20 chars then the string will not be null terminated and it will cause a segmentation fault. We are going to exploit this
