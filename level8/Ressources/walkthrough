HOW TO FIND THE FLAG:

We are going to analyse this binary file with gdb. gdb level8

disas main -> long function. The goal is here to run the 'system("/bin/sh")'.

After analysing the binary file and transforming it into c language we can see that there is 4 commands that that the user can use ;

- "auth " -> malloc of size 4 for the global variable auth and copy the content what is after 'auth ' in buf if the size of this content is lower than 30

- "reset" -> free the global variable auth

- "service" -> strncmp "service" 6 -> if buf is 'servic' then ok and strdup what is after 'servic{CHAR}' 

- "login" -> if the char at the index 32 in global variable auis not '\0' then execute the shell otherwise write Password etc

The goal here is in order to execute the shell to have a value different to 0 in the index 32 of auth,

For that first we type the command "auth " in order to malloc auth 

Then we type 'serviccopyenoughchar?' we see service is 16 bytes after auth. In order to execute the shell we need to put 16 or more chars after servicc

Here it's not enough so we get Password when we type "login"

Let's try again this time with enough char.

./level8 -> "auth " -> "serviccopyenoughcharthistime" -> "login" -> 
We get access to the shell -> cat /home/user/level9/.pass -> c542e581c5ba5162a85f767996e3247ed619ef6c6f7b76a59435545dc6259f8a
