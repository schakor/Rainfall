HOW TO FIND THE FLAG:

By analysing the binary file bonus3 with gdb and recreating the c file ->

We can see that the program return 1 if fd is NULL or argc is different of 2.

We have to put one argument so the payload will be like this ./bonus3 "SOMETHING"

fd is not going to be null because it opens the .pass file in end reportory and the group of file bonus3 is end.

In order to execute the shell the strcmp must be equal to 0 between buffer1 and argv[1]. 

So with and empty string -> atoi("") = 0 so buffer[0] = 0 and argv[1] = 0 too.

./bonus3 '' -> whoami -> end -> $ cat /home/user/end/.pass
